## üìö Customizing Questions

### Adding or Editing Questions

Edit the `public/questions.json` file to add or modify questions. Each question follows this format:

```json
{
  "q": "We surveyed 100 students: Question text here",
  "answers": ["Most common answer", "Second answer", "Third answer", "Less common", "Rare answer"],
  "points": [40, 30, 20, 8, 2]
}
```

**Tips for Creating Questions:**
- Use "Name a..." or "Name something..." format for open-ended questions
- Order answers from most to least common/obvious
- Assign higher points to more common answers (e.g., 40, 35, 30...)
- Include 2-7 possible answers per question
- Make sure answers have some variation so teams can't just guess one word

### Adding New Categories

In `questions.json`, add a new category:

```json
{
  "Your Category Name": [
    { /* question objects here */ }
  ],
  "Existing Category": [
    { /* existing questions */ }
  ]
}
```

## üîí Changing Teacher Mode Password

Edit the `TEACHER_PASSWORD` constant in `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
const TEACHER_PASSWORD = 'your-new-password';
```

## üé® Customization Ideas

- **Change the theme colors**: Edit `tailwind.config.js` or the color classes in `App.jsx`
- **Add sound effects**: Import audio files and play them on reveals/strikes
- **Add timer**: Implement a countdown for each turn
- **Team names**: Add input fields for custom team names
- **Leaderboard**: Track scores across multiple games

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Questions not loading?**
- Check that `questions.json` has valid JSON syntax
- Verify the file is in the `public` folder

**Teacher Mode not working?**
- Make sure you're entering the correct password: `biorocks`
- Check for typos in the password constant

**Build fails?**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
